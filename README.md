# SWAPI
## The Star Wars API 

Source code for [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev)


## What happened to swapi.co? 
Unfortunately swapi.co is not maintained anymore but I have created a new repo to backup all previous data, see 
https://github.com/fredatgithub/StarWarsAPI

## What is swapi.dev? 
An "unofficial" branch of "swapi", supported by @juriy


## Will it be updated?
Original swapi project is built on Python/Django stack that is quite outdated by now. 

It would be a great exercise to rewrite it in cloud-native manner, but this requires time and effort. I'm looking into doing that. There's no timelines yet, since "swapi" stopped its existence quite suddenly. Suggestions and help are always welcome!

I created a C# solution to get SWAPI data before it goes off line.
